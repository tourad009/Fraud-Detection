# Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning.

## Models

- Random Forest (`rf_model`)
- CatBoost (`cat_model`)
- LightGBM (`lgbm_model`)

## Goal

Identify fraud with high precision and recall. The F1-score is used as the main evaluation metric.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies  
2. Run `fraud_detection.py`  
3. Models are saved as `.pkl` files in the `models/` folder

## Structure

- `data/` – Dataset  
- `models/` – Saved models  
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory work  
- `fraud_detection.py` – Main script
